# Artivio

Artivio is a customizable poster marketplace where users can explore stunning design posters and make them uniquely theirs without needing design skills.

## Features

- Users can edit posters, and the edited canvas state is stored in the backend.
- Each user's edits are saved separately, allowing them to retrieve previous work.
- Users can interact with layers, move them around, add shapes and text, manipulate the object's width, height, and color, and upload their images on the canvas.
- Layer management: Each layer can be moved up and down on the Z-axis and can be deleted as well as hidden.
- Canvas data is compressed, divided into chunks, and stored in Cloudinary to efficiently handle large JSON data.
- For secure image and JSON file uploads, Cloudinary signed uploads are used.
- Users and designers can sign up and log in on the platform.
- New designers require admin approval before they can upload their designs. The admin can verify designers via email in their Gmail's inbox.

- Designers can upload posters and assets directly to Cloudinary via their dashboard.
- Integrated Stripe Checkout for payments.
- After a successful payment, an order confirmation email is sent via Nodemailer.
